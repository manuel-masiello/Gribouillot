# Gribouillot
A software to draw geometric figures on a map, with a layer system and powerful functionalities.
It was originally created to help people in search of the Golden Owl ("Chouette d'Or"), a famous
French treasure hunt.

## About this fork

This repository is an **actively maintained fork** of
[Fr3nchK1ss/Gribouillot](https://github.com/Fr3nchK1ss/Gribouillot), the original project by
Ludovic A., whose last activity dates back to **October 2020 (version 2.0)**.

It's maintained by **Elseware**, a *chouetteur* (Golden Owl hunter) who uses Gribouillot and
wanted to keep it alive and keep improving it. Since the upstream project does not appear to be
maintained anymore, development continues here instead of through pull requests to the parent.
The approach to keep the tool alive:

- **Modernization**: port to Qt6 (Qt5 remains supported), fixes for current systems;
- **New features**: e.g. the *ellipse from foci* drawing tool;
- **Distribution**: Linux, Windows and macOS binaries built automatically by GitHub Actions
  (see [Releases](https://github.com/ElsewareChouette/Gribouillot/releases));
- Same GPL3 license as the original project.

Any remark, bug report or suggestion is welcome — feel free to open an issue on this repository.

## Download

**Latest release: [v2.2.1](https://github.com/ElsewareChouette/Gribouillot/releases/tag/v2.2.1)** —
binaries for Linux (AppImage), Windows (zip) and macOS (dmg), built automatically from the
sources by the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml). All releases are listed on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/ElsewareChouette/Gribouillot/releases).

The legacy 2.0 binaries built by the upstream project (Qt5, 2018-2020) were removed from the
repository; they remain available in the
[upstream project](https://github.com/Fr3nchK1ss/Gribouillot/tree/master/bin) and in this
repository's git history.

## Build Instructions

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

#### Prerequisites
Install Qt6 development tools and dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev qt6-tools-dev-tools build-essential
```

For Qt5 (alternative):
```bash
sudo apt install qtbase5-dev qt5-qmake qttools5-dev-tools build-essential
```

#### Compilation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fr3nchK1ss/Gribouillot.git
cd Gribouillot
```

2. Generate the Makefile with qmake:
```bash
qmake6 gribouillot.pro
# Or for Qt5: qmake gribouillot.pro
```

3. Compile the project:
```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
./bin/gribouillot
```

### Windows

#### Prerequisites
1. Download and install Qt6 from the official website:
   - Visit https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer
   - Download the Qt Online Installer
   - During installation, select Qt 6.x for your compiler (MinGW or MSVC)
   - Make sure to install Qt Creator (optional but recommended)

2. Install a C++ compiler:
   - **Option A - MinGW** (comes with Qt installer)
   - **Option B - Visual Studio** (download from Microsoft)

#### Compilation with Qt Creator (Recommended)
1. Open Qt Creator
2. Click "Open Project" and select `gribouillot.pro`
3. Configure the project with your installed Qt kit
4. Click the "Build" button (hammer icon) or press Ctrl+B
5. Click the "Run" button (green play icon) or press Ctrl+R

#### Compilation with Command Line
1. Open Qt command prompt (from Start Menu → Qt → Qt 6.x)

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```cmd
cd path\to\Gribouillot
```

3. Generate the Makefile:
```cmd
qmake gribouillot.pro
```

4. Compile:
   - For MinGW:
   ```cmd
   mingw32-make
   ```
   - For MSVC (Visual Studio):
   ```cmd
   nmake
   ```

5. Run the application:
```cmd
bin\gribouillot.exe
```

### macOS

#### Prerequisites
Install Qt with Homebrew:
```sh
brew install qt
```

For Qt5 (alternative):
```sh
brew install qt@5
export PATH="$(brew --prefix qt@5)/bin:$PATH"
```

#### Compilation
1. Navigate to the project directory and generate the Makefile:
```sh
qmake gribouillot.pro
```

2. Compile the project:
```sh
make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

3. Run the application:
```sh
open bin/gribouillot.app
```

## Project Structure
- **Source files**: `*.cpp` files containing the implementation
- **Header files**: `*.h` files containing class declarations
- **UI files**: `*.ui` files for Qt Designer interface definitions
- **Resources**: `gribouillot.qrc` for application resources (icons, images)
- **Translations**: `gribouillot_fr.ts/qm` for French translation
- **Build output**: Executable is generated in the `bin/` directory

## Troubleshooting

### Linux
- If `qmake6` is not found, try `qmake` or `qmake-qt6`
- Make sure Qt XML module is installed: `sudo apt install libqt6xml6`

### macOS
- If `qmake` is not found with Qt5, make sure `qt@5` is in your PATH (it is keg-only in Homebrew)

### Windows
- Make sure the Qt bin directory is in your PATH
- If you get "qmake: command not found", use the Qt command prompt
- For missing DLLs, copy them from Qt's bin directory or use `windeployqt`
